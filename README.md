#Virtual Pet Simulator
Welcome to the Virtual Pet Simulator, a console application developed in C# to simulate caring for a virtual pet. This project covers fundamental programming concepts such as basic program structure, console I/O, data types, type conversion, and control flow elements.

Features

Pet Creation
Allow the user to choose a pet type (Cat, Dog, Rabbit) and give it a name.
Display a welcome message that includes the pet's type and name.

Pet Care Actions
Implement actions such as feeding, playing, and resting, each affecting the pet's stats.
Display messages describing the effects of each action.

Pet Status Monitoring
Track and display the petâ€™s stats: hunger, happiness, and health on a scale of 1 to 10.
Implement a status check that warns the user if any stat is critically low or high.

Time-Based Changes
Simulate the passage of time, where each action represents the passing of an hour.
Hunger increases over time, and happiness decreases slightly, prompting regular interaction.

Enhanced Interaction Logic
Implement consequences for neglect, such as health deterioration if the pet is too hungry or unhappy.
Include special messages or events based on the pet's status (e.g., the pet refusing to play if too hungry).

User Interface and Experience
Develop a simple, clear, and user-friendly console interface.
Include instructions for the user on how to interact with the application.
How to Use

Run the application.
Choose a pet type (1 for Cat, 2 for Dog, 3 for Rabbit) and enter a name.
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with your virtual pet.
Use the main menu options to feed, play, rest, check status, or exit the simulator.

Requirements
.NET Core SDK (compatible with the version used in the code)
